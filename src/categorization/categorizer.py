                 CWE-470 Name: Use of Externally-Controlled Input to Select Classes or Code ('Unsafe Reflection') Description: The application uses external input with reflection to select which classes or code to use, but it does not sufficiently prevent the input from selecting improper classes or code. examples: Java Class.forName(userInput).newInstance() where userInput comes from an HTTP parameter, Python getattr(module, user_string)() to call functions, Deserializing objects where the class name is controlled by the attacker. keywords: unsafe reflection, code execution, class loading, dynamic invocation, input validation, Class.forName, getattr, deserialization
                 CWE-798 Name: Use of Hard-coded Credentials Description: The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data. examples: Default admin password compiled into the application binary, Database connection string with username/password stored in source code, A fixed AES encryption key embedded in a mobile app. keywords: hard-coded credentials, hardcoded password, embedded key, secret in code, backdoor, insecure default
                 CWE-706 Name: Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference Description: The software uses a name or reference to access a resource, but the name/reference resolves to a resource that is outside of the intended control sphere. examples: DNS rebinding attacks where a malicious site resolves to an internal IP after an initial check, TOCTOU issues with filename resolution where a symlink is introduced, Relying on hostname resolution that can be manipulated by a local attacker (e.g., /etc/hosts). keywords: incorrect name resolution, DNS rebinding, TOCTOU, symlink attack, reference misresolution, control sphere bypass
